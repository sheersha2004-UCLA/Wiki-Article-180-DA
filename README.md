Self driving cars are changing the world. Companies such as Tesla build self-driving car features. In big cities, you see Waymo cars driving around the city without any driver. In a Tesla electric car, you can put the car in FSD(full self-driving) mode. Tesla electric cars equipped with Full Self-Driving (FSD) mode can navigate roads, follow traffic laws, and execute complex maneuvers such as parking without any direct driver interference. It can even check your blind spots as opposed to drivers having to look at the side mirror and looking at the side mirror manually to make a lane change. 

This Tesla self driving car right here is driving without a driver. They can go wherever they need to go. 


	When it comes to self-driving cars, typically the driver inside the car puts a destination in the system and the car starts driving to that location. The driver wants to prioritize shortest distance and shortest time. In some instances, the shortest pathway may not be the shortest time. In other instances, there might be quite a few errors that impact the direction that the self driving car is taking. There are several components of self-driving cars: localization, mapping, and sensing. Localization is the component where the car needs to figure out its positioning in the environment it's in. It needs to know its exact location. Mapping is the component where it maps out the route the car will take to get to a destination. The maps have information about the roads such as lane markings, traffic signs, speed limits, and potential hazards. The information is always being updated as the system being used is running. Sensing in the component where the system tries to sense where the car is at a particular point. The sensors that the system uses about the road features, hazards, other vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signals.

Self Driving Cars rely on large amounts of data gathered from various onboard sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, and radar. This is so the system can run efficiently and successfully. The cameras capture many images and are used in the system to execute to its job. These images are processed using computer vision algorithms to perform critical tasks. It includes a task such as object detection. It also includes classification where it classifies identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and cyclists. The other tasks it includes are lane detection and tracking and traffic sign and signal recognition.This raw sensor data often contains noise (errors), which can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of the information. To address this, LiDAR sensors often incorporate filters specifically designed to remove noise and improve the quality of the data used for perception and navigation. 

The three algorithms that the self driving cars use are A* Algorithm, Dijkstra’s Algorithm, and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). These algorithms are not only used in self-driving cars, but in other applications as well. It is critical to note that the three algorithms have massively helped self driving cars. A* Algorithm is the algorithm that tries to find the best route between 2 starting points. It considers the cost already traveled with an estimated cost to the goal. A* uses a graph between two points and attempts to find the shortest path. It first starts by having a start and end point. It tries to find all the obstacles in the pathway that exists. It guarantees the shortest path and is extremely flexible. Another algorithm is Dijkstra. It is slower than A* algorithm. Unlike A* algorithm, it explores all options.  It tries to find the most accurate route. Rapidly-exploring Random Trees tries to find the path with the least amount of obstacles. It often works in extremely tight spaces. The RRT algorithm is extremely fast as it wants to find a solution. However, it is critical to note that it is not always the most efficient pathway for the car. 
	A* algorithm is also primarily used in video games. Dijkstras is used in Google Maps, network routing, and video games. Google Maps tries to find the fastest route in the Dijkstra algorithm. Network routing chose optimal routes in data networks. One way that video games use Dijkstra is when characters go through a map. Rapidly-exploring Random Trees  is typically used in robotics. We can see robotic applications such as search and rescue robots and surgical robots. 
	In the end when we will look at all of this, it is important to note that self-driving cars will change the world that we live in. We see waymos or self-driving teslas in big cities. It is important to understand the algorithms behind how these self autonomous cars work. Tesla electric cars equipped with Full Self-Driving (FSD) mode can navigate roads, follow traffic laws, and execute complex maneuvers such as parking without direct driver interference. It can even check your blind spots as opposed to drivers parking manually. These self-driving cars cannot execute without having the algorithms.
